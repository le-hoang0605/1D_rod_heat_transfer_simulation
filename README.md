**PRODUCT VISION**
A complete product FOR advanced high school or college students, WHO seek a different approach to further understand the classic problem of heat transfer inside a thermally isolated 1-dimensional metal rod in their Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) course. THIS educational application is one THAT will offer visual approach to assist students and math enthusiasts in deeply understanding this infamously hard concept UNLIKE most other traditional forms of information (textbooks, lectures,...), which focus on rigid mathematical rigor. OUR product enables teachers to deliver quick and robust graphing visualization to curious students about the application of PDEs in real-life manifestations and applications in simulation, driving engineering and scientific progress.
